  <h2>What is Homebrew?</h1>
  <img id="hb-demo" class="pull-right" src="img/new3dsxl-hb.png">
  <p><b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games" target="_blank">Homebrew</a></b> usually refers to software that is not authorized by Nintendo. It allows you to run homebrew games, tools like save editing and backup, and emulators for various older systems.</p>
  <p>In most cases, running homebrew on your console is 100% free using just the Internet Browser. There are also various other exploits in commercial games to get homebrew running.</p>

  <h2>What is Custom Firmware?</h2>
  <p>Custom firmware ("CFW") enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can't easily do. For instance, signature patches let you install unsigned titles that appear right on your HOME Menu.</p>
  <p>CFW can be easily set up on any console that is on 9.2.0-20 or lower. Consoles on 10.7.0-32 or lower can be downgraded for free, those on 11.0.0 can be with hardware modifications (hardmod) or another system with CFW already set up.</p>

  <h2>How do I get these hacks?</h2>
  <p>Visit this website on your PC (if you aren't using one already), and click the "Start hax" button to begin the process.</p>
  <p class="text-danger">Unless otherwise specified, you should not update your system, as you might hinder or remove your ability to run Homebrew or CFW on your device!</p>
